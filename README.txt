A handy jQuery Coryat scorer for playing along with Jeopardy at home.

Karl Coryat (http://www.pisspoor.com/jep.html) devised a method to keep score of how well you do playing along at home while watching Jeopardy. His scoring method gained some fame after appearing on Jeopardy, and it was dubbed the "Coryat score" by fans.

I recently took the online Jeopardy contestant test, and I hope to be picked to audition someday, but in preparing, I was shocked that I couldn't find some Coryat scorekeeping mechanism either as a simple webpage somewhere or as some sort of app. So, I knocked up one with jQuery in about 30 minutes.

It's simple: if you answer a question right, click the "positive" amount button. If you answer a question wrong, hit the "negative" amount button. If you don't answer, don't click. Daily Doubles count as normal questions if you get them right (and don't count against you if you get them wrong), and there is no final Jeopardy in the Coryat score. There are some text boxes across the top of each board that you can type in the categories if you'd like. If you want to save the results, just print to a PDF or something.
